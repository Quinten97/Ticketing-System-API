    <title>Simple Ticketing API</title>
  </head>

      <h1>Simple ticketing REST API</h1>
      <p>
        Hey! thanks for checking out the project, I wrote this simple API with
        the intention of using it for my small computer repair business but
        figured that it may be of help to others if I uploaded it for use here
        on github. This is my first time writing an API so feel free to leave
        any constructive critism on how I could improve.
      </p>
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>
        I hope to have a video up soon to show how to implement this api locally
        for your private use, currently I am working on developing a frontend
        for it so it could be used locally. The goal of this project of course
        is to provide a free tool for small business owners but for now.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Clone Repository to Local Machine
          <ul>
            <li>
              this can be accomplished several ways but the most user friendly
              might be to use github for desktop, Git bash or even simply
              download the files and store them manually.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Install Node</li>
        <li>Open your terminal and navigate to the local directory</li>
        <li>
          Run npm install in your terminal to install the dependancies locally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run node server.js in your terminal to start the backend server if you
          change the name of the file remember to plug it into the command
          instead of server.js
        </li>
        <li>
          Open a browser and navigate to http://Localhost:3000 and you should be
          greeted with a static html page that is being served by the node
          server. If you changed the port remember to adjust the url as such.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enjoy! your api server is now running and is ready for local
          development for a frontend.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Endpoints</h2>
      <p>
        For those of you who want to use the API and develop your own front end
        I encourage you to clone this repository. Currently the functionality is
        very basic and limited and since this project use sqlite3 there are a
        few niche workarounds you may have to solve when building your own
        frontend. For instance! sqlite doesnt work in dates, however it will
        sort dates correctly even if they are a string as long as they are in a
        consistent format. My workaround of course then being to limit the
        format of user input for that form field.
      </p>
      <h3>GET</h3>
      <span>/tickets</span>
      <p>This endpoint returns every ticket currently in the db.</p>
      <span>/tickets/:string</span>
      <p>
        This endpoint can return every ticket that meets the search criteria,
        you can pass in any string and it will check to see if any tickets have
        a matching entry on their first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, or
        employee column.
      </p>
      <h3>POST</h3>
      <span>/tickets</span>
      <p>
        You can post a new ticket to this endpoint and it will return a response
        with the ticket data. heres an example of this endpoing using the Fetch
        api in js.
      </p>
      <span
        >fetch('http://localhost:3000/tickets', { method: 'POST', body:
        newURLSearchParams({ date: 7/22/45, firstName: jane, lastName: doe,
        email: jd@fake.net, phoneNumber: 2344323344, brandModel: dell inspiron,
        serial: 343errf, issue: broken display, notes: wanted to pay after
        repair, employee: james }) }) .then(res => { //do stuff });</span
      >
      <h3>PATCH</h3>
      <span>/tickets/:id</span>
      <p>
        patching a ticket is a little more involed but not super far off from
        how we post. To patch you'll need to pass in the id of the ticket you
        wish to update into the url as well as pass some information into the
        body of the request.
      </p>
      <span
        >fetch(`http://localhost:3000/tickets/${ticketID}`, { method: 'PATCH',
        headers: { 'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' }, body:
        newURLSearchParams({ column: 'first_name', value: 'jane' }) }) .then(res
        => { //do stuff });</span
      >
      <p>
        The PATCH method is limited to updating one column at a time so it may
        be best to have an "update" button appear when a user is changing a
        given field.
      </p>
      <h3>DELETE</h3>
      <span>/tickets/:id</span>
      <p>
        The delete endpoint works much like our second GET method, simply pass
        in the id of the ticket you wish to delete from the db.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        I'd love to see what projects people might use this for so please feel
        free to share if you decide to make anything with this API. I still want
        to work on and improve it as much as I can to give people more tools to
        use so any recommendations and CC is more than welcomed.
